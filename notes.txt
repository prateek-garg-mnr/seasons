react lifecycle methods

when a component immediately shows up on the screen of the browser

a lifecycle method called "componentDidMount()" is called 
which means if we define a function named componentDidMount() specificly in the class component this function will be automatically called one time when the component first get render on to the screen 

when a component's state is updated by this.setState then a lifecycle method defined in class component specificly called "componentDidUpdate()" is called automatically every time a that component is updated.
Every time when "componentDidUpdate()" is called, before that the render method will be called

after some time we decide to stop showing this component on the screen then "componentWillUnmount" method is called automatically and it is used if we want to do some kind of cleanup.
